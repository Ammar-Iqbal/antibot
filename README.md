# MMORPG Behavioral Data Anti-bot
This project is done using machine learning algorithms and has started during the machine learning lectures.

It's made to be compatible with [The Forgotten Server](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver).

### Getting Started (In Progress)
- You need to make a few changes in your server to capture the necessary data. I'll soon be providing what are the editions and what's the improvements that have yet to be made in order to have it fully working in a crowded server.
